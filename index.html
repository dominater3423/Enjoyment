		<h3>Game</h3>
		<p>Created a little number game with JavaScript. The only hard part of trying to figure out how to get input from the html tag into a variable in my JS file. My first program with the language.</p>
		<h3>Event Which had an Impact</h3>
		<p>One discovery which influenced me was the Linux community. It some kind of funny, but it was the first time I was exposed to a group of people who rejected the mainstream values and it replaced them with their own. It's comforting to know that at least some people care for their freedom. It was the first time I was exposed to anything related to computer science. Learning the command line was interesting, partitioning my own drives, just having the ability to change my desktop environment, window managers, etc. The developers truly believe in user freedom, and they don't insult the user's intelligence by hiding error logs or making interfaces overly simplistic. Then just being in an environment, even if it's digital, that you know is safe and respects your privacy is satisfying. Every time you boot up your computer it doesn't feel like a chore to use. It encourages you to experiment with your computer. There's a website called distrotube that tracks all the various distributions of Linux, its motto is "put the fun back in computing." At the end of the day its that, those who get the most out of it are people who enjoy learning and tinkering. I certainly fall into that catagorey.</p>
		<h3>Programming</h3>
		<p>I have this problem with learning to program. It's something I've always wanted todo, but I open some book, learn the basics of the language, then just get bored of it asking myself if I've ever going to use this. It was easy for me to learn stuff such as the the terminal or emacs because I had practical applications for them. With programming the projects that I'd like to do would require probably months or even years of constant practice. Is it worth it? Learning the basics of LaTeX, great I use that all the time, but when am I ever gonna use C or Go or Python? Maybe when I'm older I'll take some college level classes to force me to learn.</p>
		<h3>Browsers?</h3>
		<p>Are there any good browsers? The only two useable browsers are either Chrome or Firefox. Chrome is immediateley out, Chromium is open-source but still probably has malicous code somewhere in its codebase, and ungoogled-chromium I believe is behind in releases. Brave is also an option, but something feels off about it. Firefox's default settings are somewhat malicous, other than that I love the browser. Waterfox is behind in versions. Qutebrowser is nice, but not based on either the Firefox or Chromium engine, I believe it uses QTWebKit. Surf is too minimal. Nothing feels right.</p>
		<h3>Text Editors</h3>
		<p>Same thing with text editors, I can't find a text editor that satisfies me. I want something with efficient key-bindings, is somewhat minimal, and has sane settings that don't require hours to learn to configure. Emacs and Vim are immediateley out because I'm so sick of them. Whenever I use them I find myself hating some part about it, then spending hours on customizing it to fit my usage. I don't want an IDE, so they're all out. Then preferably I want something that I can run in a terminal, so those gui applications are out. There are still plenty of options, right now I'm using a small text editor called Micro; I've configured it to have keybindings reminiscent of Emacs. It's far from ideal, there is no spell cheecker or autocomplete, but it's the best I have at the moment. If I ever learn to program that will be the first program I write, a sane text editor.</p>
